# Capstone Project 
## Spooky Spaces 

   * This app is for tourists or locals of Milwaukee that are interested in ghost encounters/hauntings. With so much rich history in Milwaukee, and the gaining popularity of ghost sightings, there seems to be a growing desire to find these encounters. The difficulty of being a ghost hunter/ enthusiast is going to a new city and knowing where to begin. How does someone find something that may or may not exist? A scary good network of other ghost hunters, thatâ€™s how.  We have devised an app to solve that problem, and simultaneously generate a new scope of tourism revenue to our town, a ghost map.
