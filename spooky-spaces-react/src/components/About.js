						This app is for tourists or locals of Milwaukee that are interested
						in ghost encounters/hauntings. With so much rich history in
						Milwaukee, and the gaining popularity of ghost sightings, there
						seems to be a growing desire to find these encounters. The
						difficulty of being a ghost hunter/ enthusiast is going to a new
						city and knowing where to begin. How does someone find something
						that may or may not exist? A scary good network of other ghost
						hunters, thatâ€™s how. We have devised an app to solve that problem,
						and simultaneously generate a new scope of tourism revenue to our
						town, a ghost map.
